Types of scanning

Static source code analysis
   we use SonarQube
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) 
   Fortify
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
   we inspect
Open Source Library Scanning 
  nexus iq 
docker image scanning
 twistlock, ECR scanning

everytime we won't go for deployment as is long process

First we have to set the pre - requirment like 

dependencies installation 
build
all type of scanning
unit Testing
nexus upload

what is quality gate ?
----------------------
0 bugs
0 code smells
security rating should be A
code coverage should be more than 80


git ---> will have multiple branches.... multi branch pipeline


jenkins shared library ---> treat your pipeline as library, use it wherever you want it

how can we achieve this ?
-------------------------
1. create a feature branch in catalogue
2. configure multi branch pipeline
3. configure jenkins shared library
